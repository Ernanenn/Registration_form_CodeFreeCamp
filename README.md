# Registration Form - HTML & CSS
This project includes the code for a simple registration form with HTML and CSS.

## Features
User information collection including name, email, password, account type, profile picture (optional), age, referral source, bio, and terms and conditions agreement.
Basic form validation using required attributes and input types.

## Files
index.html: The main HTML file containing the form structure.
styles.css: The stylesheet defining the visual appearance of the form.

## Setup
Copy the index.html and styles.css files to your desired location.
Open index.html in a web browser to see the registration form.
Note: This form submits data to a demo URL (https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org) which is not intended for real user registration. You'll need to implement server-side logic to handle form submissions in a production environment.

## Customization
Edit the HTML to modify the form layout and labels.
Modify the CSS styles to personalize the form's appearance (colors, fonts, etc.).
You can add functionalities like input validation (using JavaScript) or error messages.
